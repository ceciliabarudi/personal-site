        <section>
          <p>
            Developer on a seven-person team for a Germany-based client, in which 
            I supported the maintenance and evolution of a product in charge of 
            providing personalised product recommendations to users. As one of the 
            world's biggest e-commerce companies, the main concern was developing 
            strategies to seamlessly scale the system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ensuring data redundancy, the least amount of downtime and the most 
            performant recommendation experience was paramount. Technically this involved 
            (but wasn’t limited to) a change in product data persistence mechanisms and 
            a refactor of the codebase to reduce complexity by moving towards a Clean 
            Architecture approach, all while developing new product features.

            Junior developer on a five-person team for a leading German real estate 
            company, maintaining a system that connects property sellers to real estate 
            agents. The system interacts with the client’s existing client relationship 
            management solution sending email notifications and billing invoices, and 
            integrates a dashboard allowing agents to manage the number of potential 
            customers they receive.
          </p>
          <p>
            As part of the team, I worked on implementing features and user flows to 
            increase the quality of customers acquired through the system, contributed in 
            the migration process to the new brand identity for the company, and supported 
            the onboarding of three new client developers during the product’s handover phase.

            I was part of the communications team for a feminist organization group that 
            carries out two of the biggest women’s rights marches in Paraguay. Within the team, 
            my work included planning and preparing visual deliverables to publicize events, 
            complement educational measures and engage public opinion on women’s issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite strong backlash and misinformation from anti-rights groups and conservative
            mainstream media, more than three thousand women took to the streets during the 
            International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women in November 2017, 
            and more than five thousand participated in the International Women’s Strike of 2018.
