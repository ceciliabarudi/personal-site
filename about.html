        <h4 class="base_title">Developer / Designer / Migrant / Spontaneous Singer / Lover of All Things Pretty</h4>
        <p>
          I'm a career changer: I previously worked as a graphic, content and web designer 
          for seven years while living in Asunción (Paraguay), serving customers in various 
          sectors as well as educational institutions, nonprofits and activist organizations. 
          When I discovered programming a few years ago, the realization that I could not 
          only design but also build amazing experiences for people turned my life around. 
          After a transatlantic move to pursue a bootcamp in web development at Ironhack 
          I started my developer journey at 
          <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/careers/graduates"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ThoughtWorks's graduate program</a> in 
          Barcelona and have since worked for customers in the real estate and retail industries.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've a knack for frontend technologies and an interest in interactivity, 
          data visualization and accessibility. I'm passionate about making knowledge 
          and technology available to as many different people as possible so more voices 
          can enter the conversation and affect positive social change.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a developer, I feel most accomplished when I get to write tests and code (in 
          that order) that are clean and maintainable. However, the designer in me needs to 
          know we’re building the right thing. That’s why I value collaboration across disciplines 
          and fast feedback in order to balance users' needs with the technical aspects of projects.
          I hope for this little corner of the internet to be a home for my present and future 
          endeavors: the more I learn, the more I realize how much more I need to learn, 
          and I'd love to share it.
